# Features!
## Villagers
- Search villagers by **name**, **species**, **personality**, or **birthday**.
- Enjoy discovering each villager's **personal quote** and **catchphrase**.
- Note: Due to a lack of recent API updates, this project does **not** currently display the 16 new villagers added in the v2.0 update. If you know of an up-to-date API, please let me know!

## Critters
- Search bugs, fish, and sea creatures by **species**, **location**, **rarity**, or **month available**.
- Toggle your hemisphere by clicking the **globe** icon next to the search bar.
- Easily see the **sell price** and **time available** of every critter at a glance.
- Critters that are currently available to catch are **automagically** highlighted.
- Click on a critter to read the **full speech** given by museum curator **Blathers** when that critter is donated.

## Fossils & Art
- Search fossils and art by **name**.
- Click on a fossil to read the **full speech** given by museum curator **Blathers** when that fossil is donated.
- Click on an art piece to read the **museum description**.
- Note: There's more I want do with these sections, but I am limited by the API. **May or may not** become much more awesome in the future.

## Ambience
- Enjoy the **soothing** soundtrack of AC:NH as you browse the database. The track played syncs up to your local time for the **authentic** Animal Crossing experience.
- Oh no, is the **2pm** music playing? Have no fear, toggle the music off with the **speaker button** at the top of the page.
- Prefer the **rain** to the heat of the sun? So do I. Click the **weather icon** at the top to bring on the rain, and enjoy the accompanying rainy music track.

## More to come...?
