# Features
## Villagers
- Search villagers by name, species, personality, or birthday.
- Enjoy discovering each villager's personal quote and catchphrase.
- Note: Due to a lack of recent API updates, this project does not currently display the 16 new villagers added in the v2.0 update. I'm looking into addressing this, when I can.

## Critters
- Search bugs, fish, and sea creatures by species, location, rarity, or month available.
- Critters that are currently available to catch are automagically highlighted.
- Toggle your hemisphere by pressing the globe icon next to the search bar.
- Easily see the sell price and time available of every critter at a glance.
- Click on a critter to read the full speech given by museum curator Blathers when that critter is donated- **_whenever you like!_**

## Ambience
- Enjoy the soothing soundtrack of _AC:NH_ as you browse the database. The track played syncs up to your local time for the authentic Animal Crossing experience.
